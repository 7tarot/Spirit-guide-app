      "backstory": "Mireth walks with dirt under their nails and a calendar of seed catalogues in their head. In cloisters built of cedar, they trained gardeners who could read a year by the smell of the soil. If Mireth visits you, life is asking for stewardship, not spectacle. Start where you are soft: water the plant, sort the drawer, reply to the kindest email first. Growth, they insist, is mostly chores performed with respect. Mireth’s patience is not passive. It is attentive. They will teach you to prune what steals light—old obligations, tired self-images, commitments that once were kind but now are cages. Under their care, you’ll notice how many miracles happen at countertop height: bread rising, glue drying, ideas sprouting while you wash a bowl. You will learn to track your seasons and trust them. Winter is for roots. Spring is for experiments. Summer is for stamina. Autumn is for thanks and editing. With Mireth, you will become a student of maintenance as devotion. Your future wants to be fed. Put habits where your hands already go. Keep your tools visible and your expectations humane. Praising small progress will feel like rain. In a year, people will ask how you got so lucky. You’ll smile and point to the watering can.",
